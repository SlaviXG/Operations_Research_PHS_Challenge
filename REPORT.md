# Operational Research Challenge

## Problem Formulation 
### Part One: The central problem we aim to solve is optimizing the allocation and utilization of Accident & Emergency (A&E) services within a defined geographic area. This includes minimizing unnecessary use of A&E services, improving patient flow efficiency, and ensuring that patients receive timely and appropriate care.

# Key Questions to Address (Objectives)
 - How can we reduce unnecessary A&E attendances through reallocation and pre-arrival guidance?
 - What are the optimal resource allocation strategies to minimize waiting times at A&E?
 - Where should additional resources (e.g., MIUs, GP capacity) be allocated geographically to ease pressure on A&E?
 - How do different attendance types (e.g., planned, unplanned, frequent re-attenders) impact A&E demand and resource needs?
 - How can we improve patient understanding of the best facility to visit based on their condition?


## Data Collection
### Since all the data has already been provided already, here is a heatmap created to show the correlation between each data definition. The Correlation is being shown using the Spearman's rank Correlation. [From google - In statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's œÅ, named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter or as, is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.]

## Mathematical Modelling - Using Queuing Theory for Wait Times & Linear Optimizing website for the main re-allocation problem. 
### Performance Measures - Wait Times and Effective Re-allocation. Thinking only about the worst case scenario: everyone that comes into the department is a new - unplanned attendance. 
### Alternative Courses of Action - Use of Event Driven Process Chains and or State Tables

## Choosing Resolving Method
### Analyze the Alternatives to understand outcomes of each (consequences)
### Comparison of the consequences and selection of the right alternative

## Resolving Problem
### Results and Conclusions

## Implementation of Solution
### Implementation of the result and evaluation of the degree/percentage of success.
