# Operational Research Challenge
## Problem Description
### Part One: The primary objective is to re-allocate demand for A&E services among list of departments to improve efficiency. In simple terms, Public Health Scotland wants to understand if patient flows to A&E sites could be better managed by redistributing the demand across existing departments. This would involve:

 - Reducing patient balancing the load across sites.
 - Factoring in patient demographics and site characteristics to ensure equitable access.

This model would then be used to help understand the flow of patients being admitted to the hospital system.

Flow chart model. Begin from Check(Attendance_Type) -> Site_Code -> Check(Site_Type) -> Drive_Time_mins -> Drive_Distance_Miles -> Age_Group -> Number_Of_Attendances -> Wait_Time (END)
