# Operational Research Challenge
## Problem Description
### Part One: The primary objective is to re-allocate demand for A&E services among various departments to improve efficiency. In simple terms, Public Health Scotland wants to understand if patient flows to A&E sites could be better managed by redistributing the demand across existing departments. This would involve:

 - Reducing patient wait times and balancing the load across sites.
 - Minimizing travel time for patients while considering department capacities.
 - Factoring in patient demographics and site characteristics to ensure equitable access.
