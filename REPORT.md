# Operational Research Challenge

## Problem Description
### Part One: The central problem we aim to solve is optimizing the allocation and utilization of Accident & Emergency (A&E) services within a defined geographic area. This includes minimizing unnecessary use of A&E services, improving patient flow efficiency, and ensuring that patients receive timely and appropriate care.

# Key Questions to Address
 - How can we reduce unnecessary A&E attendances through reallocation and pre-arrival guidance?
 - What are the optimal resource allocation strategies to minimize waiting times at A&E?
 - Where should additional resources (e.g., MIUs, GP capacity) be allocated geographically to ease pressure on A&E?
 - How do different attendance types (e.g., planned, unplanned, frequent re-attenders) impact A&E demand and resource needs?
 - How can we improve patient understanding of the best facility to visit based on their condition?


## Data Collection
### Since all the data has already been provided already, here is a heatmap created to show the correlation between each data definition. The Correlation is being shown using the Spearman's rank Correlation. [From google - In statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's ρ, named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter or as, is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.]

## Modelling
### To create an equation for minimizing unnecessary A&E attendances through reallocation and pre-arrival guidance, we’ll define a score or index that reflects the necessity for a patient to go to a full Emergency Department (ED) versus a Minor Injury Unit (MIU) or GP. The goal is to route patients to the most appropriate care level based on their condition, distance, wait time, and site availability. This score could guide us in deciding if a patient should be advised to visit an ED or if they can be directed to an alternative healthcare provider.
