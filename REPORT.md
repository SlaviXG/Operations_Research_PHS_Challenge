# Operational Research Challenge

## Problem Description
### Part One: The central problem we aim to solve is optimizing the allocation and utilization of Accident & Emergency (A&E) services within a defined geographic area. This includes minimizing unnecessary use of A&E services, improving patient flow efficiency, and ensuring that patients receive timely and appropriate care.

# Key Questions to Address
 - How can we reduce unnecessary A&E attendances through reallocation and pre-arrival guidance?
 - What are the optimal resource allocation strategies to minimize waiting times at A&E?
 - Where should additional resources (e.g., MIUs, GP capacity) be allocated geographically to ease pressure on A&E?
 - How do different attendance types (e.g., planned, unplanned, frequent re-attenders) impact A&E demand and resource needs?
 - How can we improve patient understanding of the best facility to visit based on their condition?


## Data Collection
### Since all the data has already been provided already, here is a heatmap created to show the correlation between each data definition. The Correlation is being shown using the Spearman's rank Correlation. [From google - In statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's œÅ, named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter or as, is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.]
