### This GitHub Repo contains the following

 - Computations performed
    - Loading Function: Used in Part One of the Solution
    - K-Means Clustering: Used in Part Two of the Solution
    - Dummy datasets used for the Computations

 - Data Visualisation Assests
    - Images: Not all images were used, only a few made it to the final solution.
    - Video
    - home.html: An example of what the Web App would look like
    - loadscore.html: An example of how the load score would be displayed

 - Data Analysis & Visualisation
    - analysis.ipynb: Used Spearman's correlation to identify and visualize the data points with the strongest relationship. 
    - data_analysis.py: Used to create a summary of data set given.
    - kmeans_clustering.py: initial testing of the algorithm.
    - leaky_token_bucket.py: initial testing of a possible solution.
    - voronoi_diagram.py: initial testing for visualizing K-Means Clustering
